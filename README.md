# Competition-Problem-Solutions

This repository is a personal collection of solutions to programming challenges.

If I can, I generally prefer to solve said problems in Python, in part because 
there are fewer Python solutions already out there than those for C++/Java.
I would consider using Pascal for the same reason, but frankly, my time these 
days is pretty limited.

Hopefully, someone will glance at one or two of these solutions, and it will 
aid them in their quests for knowledge, just as others' code has done (and 
still does every day) for me.
